# Mods
Various random mods I've created to aid arma missions in one way or another. There's no common theme, other than Bose has needed the functionality at some point.

Big shout out to CBA/ACE3 for the format of this modpack, as well as the CI testing suite etc.

## Building
Requires HEMTT. I'll type this section out more, once I have something substantial to share.

## Licence
These mods are released under the GNU GPLv3 licence. You can do almost anything you want with these mods, except distributing closed source versions. Want to repack into your in-house mod? That's fine. Want to upload that to Steam? No problem. Want to modify it? Upload the code to a public place, like a GitHub repo -- or better yet, make a pull request!
